# vue-api-client

The `<form>` tag for the 21st century.

Whether you are writing `this.$axios` in your components lifecycle hooks, or if you use `<api-client>` tags in your template, you are coupling API communication to your component. Depending on your use case this may or may not be a good thing. Using `<api-client>` tags simply moves the expression of your intent into the template. This keeps your script section clean for logic related to your data, and not filled with xhr boilerplate. 

You might be surprised at how expressive your components can become!
